There are two sections of the site, `/docs` and everything else:

* `/docs` - [github.com/rackerlabs/docs-quickstart](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-quickstart)
* `/`, `/blog`, `/sdks`, etc. - [github.com/rackerlabs/docs-developer-blog](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-developer-blog)

If you want to see behind the covers to know the layout, check out the [control repository](https://github.com/rackerlabs/nexus-control).
