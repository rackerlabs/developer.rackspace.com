This website is owned by the Developer Relations Group (DRG) at Rackspace.


HOW DO I GET AHOLD OF SOMEONE ABOUT THIS SITE?
----------------------------------------------
The best way to get ahold of someone at the DRG is via email to:
   drg-devs@rackspace.com


WHERE CAN I VIEW THE LOGS?

WHAT TOOLS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND SYSTEMS ARE BEING USED HERE (AKA buzzwords)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ansible
   Ansible is an automation tool used for app deployment, configuration
   management, etc. In this particular case, Ansible is used when provisioning
   the servers used. 

   Jenkins
   Jenkins is a Continuous Integration (CI) utility that will “watch” the GitHub
   repository (https://github.com/rackerlabs/developer.rackspace.com) for any
   committed changes and, when found, begin the web site build process.

   nginx
   nginx is the HTTP (web) server used to serve up the web site.

   http://github.com/rackerlabs/developer.rackspace.com
   This is the URL of the GitHub repository for the web site, i.e. the source
   code.



WHAT'S THE ARCHITECTURE OF THIS WEB SITE?
-----------------------------------------

NOTE THE FOLLOWING IP ADDRESSES ARE AS OF MAY 28, 2014 AND MAY HAVE CHANGED.

Two web servers running nginx:
   "webserver_1" (IP address is 23.253.229.165)
   "webserver_2" (23.253.229.5) 
They are behind a load balancer
   "developer.rackspace.com" (23.253.121.156).

Jenkins is used to build the site. The Jenkins server is at:
   23.253.225.209:8080

The build is fired automagically when GitHub changes. The Jenkins job
builds the site and publishes it to the two web servers. This shouldn't
take more than 30 seconds.



HOW CAN I RESTART THIS SITE?
----------------------------
Run the following command to stop and restart the nginx web server:
    service nginx restart
