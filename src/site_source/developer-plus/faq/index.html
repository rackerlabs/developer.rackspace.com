      <h3><a name="what_is" id="what_is"></a>What is the developer+ program?</h3>

      <p>developer+ is a program to introduce developers to Rackspace, the Rackspace Cloud, managed services,
        and Fanatical Support® via developer to developer support.  The program also helps developers to grow with 
        Rackspace and to experience, first hand, the Managed Cloud.</p>
        
      <p>Fundamentally, the developer+ program is an incubator for your idea. It is a Infrastructure Credit
        and period of time for you to experience the full portfolio of Rackspace's cloud and build out
        your idea or business. Want to test out an MVP web application? You can do that. Experience
        CoreOS + Docker? You can do that as well (our CoreOS images are updated weekly). We want to
        provide you with what you need to build out modern applications on the world's largest OpenStack™
        powered cloud.</p>

      <p>Participants in the developer+ program do not pay a Service Level Rate or Service level minimum.
        They are provided with an infrastructure credit for 12 months that covers all Rackspace Cloud services
         As with all Rackspace customers, participants in developer+ are provided the following services at
        no charge: Cloud DNS, Cloud Orchestration, Cloud Monitoring, Mailgun™ (first 50,000 emails free), and Cloud
        Networking. Some support options in the customer portal have been replaced for developer+ customers, such as
        one-to-one chat, support tickets, and the phone number. Tickets have been replaced with Billing Inquiries.</p>

      <p>As new products and services come online, they may be added to and highlighted in this program.</p>

      <p>Additionally, developer+ includes several direct feedback mechanisms as part of the terms and conditions of
        signup that allow our teams to get direct, honest feedback from customers. This is key to the development of
        the program.</p>

      <p>For additional information, see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/rackspace-developer-program-for-developers-by-developers">the
        official announcement</p>.

      <p>The Infrastructure credit is at this time $50 (30 GBP) per month for 12 months.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="limited" id="limited"></a>Are the services rate limited?</h3>

      <p>No, any rate limits that apply are our documented default service limits for all Rackspace customers,
        we have in no way throttled, crippled or otherwise made this a technically lesser program for developers.</p>

      <p>You have complete access to all services and features.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="identified" id="identified"></a>How is developer+ identified in the different Service Levels?</h3>

      <p>Customers in the developer+ program are a part of the Managed Infrastructure service level, but have limited
        access to phone and chat resources and have a customized self-service view within the control panel.</p>

      <p>Additionally, we offer developer-to-developer online support, which is delivered to developers in a way they
        are used to and expect. Developer-to-developer differs from online support only in scope and location--it is
        still the exceptional customer experience delivered by Fanatical Support that customers expect from
        Rackspace.</p>

      <p>The following features are part of developer+:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An enriched developer portal, developer guides and a continually improved developer experience based on
          direct feedback
        </li>
        <li>Rackspace Developer-to-Developer and troubleshooting support from our experts for your code leveraging our
          interfaces (APIs and SDKs)
        </li>
        <li>IRC (#rackspace on irc.freenode.net)</li>
        <li>StackOverflow Community Forums, email, Hacker News, and other online communities<br><strong>Note:</strong>
          Tickets filed are limited to billing inquires only.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3><a name="add_service" id="add_service"></a>What if developers want to add another server? Test a website or
        database?</h3>

      <p>developer+ customers can consume cloud at a "pay for what you consume" competitive prices for all services
        in any region. They can consume ObjectRocket™, OnMetal™--everything currently
        available to our other customers.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="upgrade" id="upgrade"></a>Can developers+ participants upgrade to another service level?</h3>

      <p>At any time, participants in the program may log into the Control Panel and upgrade to our Managed Cloud
        service levels. Customers may not, however, switch to developer+.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="existing" id="existing"></a>Can existing customers have their accounts moved to developer+?</h3>

      <p>Not at this time; new accounts only.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="billing" id="billing"></a>How are developer+ customers billed?</h3>

      <p>Customers in developer+ pay only for infrastructure they consume over $50 (30 GBP) per month for 12 months.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="expiration" id="expiration"></a>What happens at the end of 12 months?</h3>

      <p>Customers in developer+ will be contacted prior to the 12 month term to discuss upgrading to
        the Managed Infrastructure or Managed Operations service levels. By default, at the end of 12 months
        the Managed Infrastructure level will be applied including Service Level rates.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="slas" id="slas"></a>Are developer+ customers eligiable for the SLA guarantees covered by Managed
        Infrastructure?</h3>

      <p>Yes, but their credit is reduced by 50 percent as noted in the Terms and Conditions.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="difference" id="difference"></a>What is the difference between developer+ and the Startup Program?</h3>

      <p>developer+ offers a way for developers who are comfortable writing and deploying their code and require
        minimal assistance to use the Rackspace Cloud. </p>

      <p>The Rackspace Startup Program offers discounted infrastructure as a service and leverages Rackspace’s
        knowledge and experience in the business and technology communities to offer developing companies advice on
        how to best architect their product. The Startup Program also connects entrepreneurs to tools like
        ObjectRocket™ and Mailgun™, and gives them access to guidance on their startup through our extensive network
        of startup and technology business professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
