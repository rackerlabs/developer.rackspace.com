[Python Tennessee](https://www.pytennessee.org/) was a wonderfully put together conference with a great variety of speakers.

## Opening Keynote

{% img 2015-02-12-i-loved-pytennessee/pytn_audience.jpg %}

Giving a talk at PyTennessee was wonderful. The audience responded with Hi, Good Morning, and laughed at my jokes.

Largely speaking, I came to speak on some of the ephemeral docker workflows I've been working on with [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter) and with the [cloudpipe project](https://github.com/cloudpipe). This included a bit on the [Nature demo](https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/how-did-we-serve-more-than-20000-ipython-notebooks-for-nature/), a bit on [tmpnb](https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb), PiCloud, multyvac, and the future with cloudpipe.

Since the audience was of varying background and skillset, I made sure to talk a little bit about putting up a Flask app with Docker.

After this, there was plenty of time for questions. The biggest question that got asked multiple ways was what the future was like for multi user notebook servers. People saw the utility of JupyterHub, tmpnb, colaboratory, and Google Drive integration each individually.

Beyond that, I also showed the audience the JupyterHub that is currently run by Jess Hamrick for her Computational Models class.

People were astounded to see this in action. [Brian J. Geiger](https://twitter.com/thefoodgeek) from the Center for Open Science was eager to see this for their team and is making me think hard about how multi user notebook servers can be set up.

Apparently my timing was good, as I snuck it in just before planned maintenance on the JupyterHub setup:

The reception to the talk must have been pretty good, since so many people came up to talk to me about Docker, IPython, Jupyter, tmpnb, and JupyterHub. It was WONDERFUL!

One tweet really hit my feels, since it really got at why I was *so* excited to talk about building services with Docker and Python:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Reading through tmpnb code after <a href="https://twitter.com/rgbkrk">@rgbkrk</a>&#39;s talk <a href="https://twitter.com/PyTennessee">@PyTennessee</a>. I&#39;m impressed how simple python+docker made creating such an amazing service!</p>&mdash; sciurus (@sciurus) <a href="https://twitter.com/sciurus/status/564100686888337411">February 7, 2015</a></blockquote>

Containers are such a wonderful building block and Docker provides a great API to build **really interesting** systems.

## The Glorious Food

The PyTennessee organizers taunted everyone by Twitter by tweeting and retweeting about the food that was present throughout the conference.

To quell your inner hunger as foodie and programmer, [Adrienne Lowe](https://twitter.com/adriennefriend) gave a [talk on pairing recipes with fine exercises from Learn Python the Hard Way](https://www.pytennessee.org/schedule/presentation/76/).

## Talks I attended

### [Cutting Off the Internet: Testing Applications that Use Requests](https://www.pytennessee.org/schedule/presentation/54/)

[Ian Cordasco](https://twitter.com/sigmavirus24) spoke on the many learning lessons he experienced in testing [github3.py](https://github.com/sigmavirus24/github3.py)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Ways to .....FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFail at testing with <a href="https://twitter.com/sigmavirus24">@sigmavirus24</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pytn?src=hash">#pytn</a> <a href="http://t.co/srDK17EsFV">pic.twitter.com/srDK17EsFV</a></p>&mdash; Kyle R Kelley (@rgbkrk) <a href="https://twitter.com/rgbkrk/status/564154607744856064">February 7, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

...as well as [betamax](https://github.com/sigmavirus24/betamax), a VCR he wrote for Python requests (in the style of Ruby's VCR gem).

### [Why Your Next API Should Be Designed By A Linguist](https://www.pytennessee.org/schedule/presentation/82/)

[Rebecca Standig](https://twitter.com/understandig) made people think hard about how they design APIs and why language matters.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>&quot;Learning an API should be intuitive - not hard to figure out.

### [Docker in Action - fitter, happier, more productive](https://www.pytennessee.org/schedule/presentation/51/)

Michael Herman gave the audience a wonderful introduction to Docker, services around Docker, and how to deploy a simple Flask App.

### [Twitter Network Analysis with NetworkX](https://www.pytennessee.org/schedule/presentation/52/)

This talk/tutorial stepped up their game by providing a handout.

## Closing up

PyTennessee was incredible and as I always end up seeing, bigger than I expected for a regional conference. Hats off to the organizers for putting together such a great conference.

I can't wait until PyTennessee 2016!
