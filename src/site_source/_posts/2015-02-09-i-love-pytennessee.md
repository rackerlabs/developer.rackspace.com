[Python Tennessee](https://www.pytennessee.org/) was a wonderfully put together conference with a great variety of speakers.

## Opening Keynote

Giving a talk at PyTennessee was wonderful. Everyone said Hi, Good Morning, and laughed at my jokes.

...

Showed the audience the JupyterHub that is currently run by Jess Hamrick for her Computational Models class.

They were astounded to see this in action. [Brian J. Geiger](https://twitter.com/thefoodgeek) from the Center for Open Science was eager to see this for their team and is making me think hard about how multi user notebook servers can be set up.

Apparently my timing was good, as Jess had some planned maintenance on the JupyterHub setup:

One tweet really hit my feels, since it really got at why I was *so* excited to talk about building services with Docker and Python:

Containers are such a wonderful building block and Docker provides a great API to build **really interesting** systems.

After the talk, so many people came up to talk to me about Docker, IPython, Jupyter, tmpnb, and JupyterHub. It was WONDERFUL!

I also really messed up. Apparently if you ask a group of people if we can move out into the hall to continue talking, they disperse after they cross the doorway. All I can think of is that
